## ABOUT 
This code assists in the automatic tracking of your PC's battery percentage, enabling you to make informed decisions about when to plug in or unplug your device.

## HOW IT WORKS:

**Setting Your Preference** : To get started, you specify the percentage interval you want to track. For example, if you wish to be notified when your battery increases or decreases by 1%, simply reply with "1" when prompted.

**Continuous Monitoring** : Once your preference is set, the code runs continuously in the background, keeping a vigilant eye on your laptop's battery status.

**Timely Notifications** : Whenever your battery charge percentage changes by the interval you specified, the script promptly sends you a notification. These notifications serve as real-time updates, informing you about your battery's charge level.

**User-Friendly Monitoring** : With this script, you no longer need to rely solely on your system's battery icon or guess when to plug in or unplug your device. It provides you with a user-friendly and precise way to monitor your battery, helping you make informed decisions to maximize your laptop's battery life and performance.

## USE CASES:

**Battery Icon Missing** : Your battery icon may have disappeared from the notification bar, making it challenging to monitor your battery status. This script provides a practical solution for tracking your battery's charge level and receiving notifications when it changes.

**Precise Battery Monitoring** : Sometimes, the standard battery indicator in the notification bar provides only limited information. With this script, you can monitor your battery at a much finer level of detail. For example, you can track how your battery charge percentage changes over time, which can be useful for understanding your device's power consumption patterns.

**Optimizing Device Usage** : If you want to optimize your device usage by plugging or unplugging your laptop at specific battery levels, this script simplifies the process. You can set your preferred percentage interval, and the script will notify you precisely when it's time to take action, helping to extend your battery's lifespan.

**Monitoring Charge or Discharge Speed**: This script not only tracks battery discharge but also monitors charging. If you want to know how quickly your laptop charges or the impact of different chargers on charging speed, you can use this tool to observe charging behavior in real-time.

**Resource Conservation** : For users concerned about power conservation, this script can assist in monitoring battery drain and identifying applications or processes that are consuming excessive power. It allows for proactive power management by notifying users when their device's power is significantly impacted.

**Enhancing Portability** : If you frequently use your laptop in situations where a power outlet may not be readily available, this script helps you stay informed about your battery status. Whether you're on the go or in a remote location, you can rely on timely notifications to manage your power usage effectively.

**Battery Health Assessment**: Regularly monitoring your battery's charge and discharge patterns can provide insights into your battery's health over time. By analyzing how your battery behaves under different conditions, you can make informed decisions about battery replacement or maintenance.
